# Introduction to Base Link

## Goals

There are a few goals for making this language:

1. **Reading**. By having a very minimal syntax, it means less to put in
   your memory and less to visually parse, even if it is more verbose in
   the end. It's along the same lines as explicit is better than
   implicit.
2. **Writing**. In many cases when you take notes you just want to
   create simple records of things, especially if you are curating
   information. This format minimizes the amount of note taking while
   maximizing readability.
3. **Sharing**. Having a normalized way of writing algorithms and types
   and such in a readable language in academic papers would be nice,
   instead of every paper inventing their own syntax.
4. **Understanding**. Almost all code except really for the
   functions/actions themselves can be declarative. So writing most code
   in a concise and readable form would make coding even more rewarding,
   and would make the mental model as simple as possible.
5. **Customizing**. Having the ability to create your own writing tree
   structures for your own knowledge domains would mean you can make
   your knowledge structured and readable. A lot of writing software
   APIs is about creating a domain specific language (DSL), or chainable
   APIs which are basically the same thing.
6. **Working**. Customizability is great for establishing conventions,
   which you can reuse to reduce mental burden and move quickly, while
   making sure it is readable and concise to not just you but your team
   and the community.
