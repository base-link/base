Hosts are basically namespaces or bindings to values. Basically they are defining arbitrary objects.

host foo
  host bar
    task x
    form y
    host z
      host a, text <Foo>
        note <Foo>
    slot x
    stem test
      test is-equal
        loan a
        loan b
      slot x
        host w
        host r
