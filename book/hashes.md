# Hash Tables in BaseLink

Hash tables, also known as hash maps or dictionaries, are powerful data
structures that allow efficient storage and retrieval of key-value
pairs. In BaseLink, you can leverage the built-in `@tunebond/bolt`
module to work with hash tables seamlessly. Let's explore the potential
use cases and the functionality provided by the BaseLink API for hash
tables.

```link
load @tunebond/bolt
  find hash

save x
  make hash
    save <Foo>, <bar>
    save <Key>, <value>

call x/save, <Another key>, 123
save foo, call x/read, <Foo>
call x/size

walk hash, loan x
  hook tick
    take key
    show <{key}>
```

The above code snippet demonstrates the usage of hash tables in
BaseLink.

Hash tables are versatile data structures that can be used in various
scenarios, such as caching, data indexing, lookup tables, and more. With
BaseLink's hash table API, you have the flexibility to store, retrieve,
and manipulate key-value pairs efficiently. Whether you need to store
configuration settings, track user preferences, or manage data
relationships, hash tables in BaseLink provide a powerful tool to handle
these tasks with ease and speed.
