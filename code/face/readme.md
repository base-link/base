# Frontend Website

The goal of this website is to be basically an entrypoint to:

1. The packages for the base link language.
1. A playground for playing around with the language.
1. A guides section for learning the language.
1. Organization/user pages (for "namespaces" that have signed up, under
   /@foo, like how GitHub works)
1. Login page

The font should use [Google Noto Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto)
(specifically
[Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono)).
The color scheme should be white background with black text, and code
blocks which are black background, using the
[Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com).
