The stick classes are a set of B+tree classes implementing various B+trees for storing collections of items. They include:

- chain
- latch
- hatch
- weave

## The chain stick

The chain stick is an index-based tree, like an array.

## The latch stick

The latch stick is a key-only tree, like a set data structure.

## The hatch stick

The hatch stick is a key-value tree, like a hash but instead using a tree.

## The weave stick

This is a combination of chain and hatch stick.
