This is JS code written to consume LS data structures and evaluate them as code.

For example, taking a set of view definitions and rendering them.

Or parsing a string using a set of mints.

Or parsing a link tree using mints.

We write the data structure in link script itself, but because we are more familiar with writing JavaScript, we write the initial algorithms using JavaScript. Then we port the JavaScript algorithms to link script.

Evaluating the test files is another example.

Generating a string from data is another.

For now just compiling into JavaScript. But later into Swift, then assembly.
