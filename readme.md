## Introduction

TermTree is a cross-platform application framework _in development_
(extreme **prototype**). It is far from being working, so mainly just a
collection of packages with API ideas. The long term goal is to now get
this working :).

_Check out the
"[Book](https://github.com/termsurf/term.tree/tree/make/book)" for the
most up-to-date examples and outlines of how this might end up working._

## Installation

```
pnpm add @termsurf/term -g
```

## Dependencies

TermTree is aimed to be built as a set of APIs, which you can swap out
the implementation for (as ones figure out more optimal approaches, like
how normal software tools evolve generation after generation). But we
will have a default set of implementations to start.

| Package                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [`make.tree`](https://github.com/termsurf/make.tree) | **Compiler.** This will do typechecking and compile the code to output runtimes. This will also do regular code linting and formatting (like prettier and ESLint). And it will allow for debugging and setting breakpoints, all from within the same AST and compilation scope. Finally, it will contain the runtime module. |
| [`deck.tree`](https://github.com/termsurf/deck.tree) | **Package Management Library.** This will handle resolving, fetching, and publishing packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

All of these are wrapped into the singular `term.tree` library, and you
import from that.

## Folder Structure

Ignore the key folders in `.gitignore`:

```.gitignore
/.term  # compiled helper folder
/bind   # environment variables
/hold   # temporary folder
/host   # generated content folder
/link   # downloaded packages folder
```

Here is how a monolithic app might be structured:

```
/.gitignore
/.term
/term.tree
/bind # env variables, don't commit
  /test.tree
  /term.tree
  /work.tree # dev
  /moon.tree # staging
  /star.tree # prod
/hold # scratchpad/tmp folder
/host
  /javascript
    /browser
    /node
  /log # logs
    /work.tree # dev logs
    /test.tree # test logs
/note # guides
/link
/deck
  /form # schema
    /code
      /user.tree
  /line # command line processing
  /back # backend
    /deck
      /site-1
      /site-2
      /hook # REST and webhook handlers
        /task # handle API calls
        /take
        /save
      /note # mailers
      /work # jobs
        /time # cron jobs
      /form # schema
        /user.tree
      /call
        /take # query allowance
      /rule # policies/permissions
  /face # frontend
    /deck
      /test
      /dock # ui components
      /vibe # styles/themes
      /site-1
        /wall # pages
          /host
            /term.tree
            /case.tree
            /deck
              /term.tree
              /case.tree
        /text # copy
      /kink # errors
      /file # public directory
        /text # fonts
        /view # images
  /base # database
    /seed # seeding data
    /move # migrations
  /site # infrastructure
    /hold.tree # don't commit this
    /move # migrations
/task # dev helpers
/text # copy
  /en.tree
  /fr.tree
  /zh.tree
```

For libraries, you might only have:

```
/term.tree
/code
/task
/hold
/host
/link
/note
```

## Interfaces

The package manager and several other components can possibly be swapped
out potentially in the future, each just depends on a small interface.

### Package Manager Interface

```ts
const deck = new Deck({ home: '.' })

// save global package
Deck.save()

// remove global package
Deck.toss()

// verify global package
Deck.test()

// link global package
Deck.link()

// install defined packages
deck.load()

// add a package
deck.save({ link, mark, site })

// remove a package
deck.toss({ link, mark, site })

// verify a deck
deck.test({ link, mark, site })

// link a package
deck.link({ link, mark, site })

// resolve file link
deck.find({ file, base })
```

### Compiler Interface

```ts
class Code {
  make() {
    this.load()
    this.mesh()
    this.lint()
    this.tree()
    this.text()
    this.bind()
  }

  bind() {
    code.on('file', code.make)
  }

  // load from the entrypoint of the project
  load() {}

  // do type-checking, variable resolution, optimizations, etc..
  mesh() {}

  // do linting and fix up code
  lint() {}

  // make output AST in target language
  make() {}

  // write the AST to string
  text() {}
}
```

### Output Generator Interface

```ts
const host = new Host({ code })

const ts = host.make({ form: 'typescript' })
const rust = host.make({ form: 'rust' })
```

The output is typed as a standard AST in each language.

## TODO

- parse mine/mind files (mint)
  - parse tree-role file types
  - parse chat-talk-link tree
  - convert into json
