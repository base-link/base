### Welcome

Welcome to the `stone` compiler. You are in the right place. Here you will find the implementation of a new tree-based language, in the form of a compiler. If it pique's your interest, you are more than welcome to contribute or offer your suggestions. The end goal is to make a powerful yet simplified programming environment that everyone in the world can participate in.

### Summary

Stone is a compiler for the XO programming language. Currently it compiles to JSON, which you can then transform and do as you wish. In the future we plan on adding support for "packages" ("stacks") and for making [runtimes](https://github.com/mountbuild/drive) for the browser in JavaScript, MacOS/iOS in Swift, Linux in Assembly, Windows in JavaScript, and Android in Kotlin.

```bash
npm install @mountbuild/stone
```

```js
const build = require('@mountbuild/stone')

const code = `
  write |hello world|
`

console.log(build(code))
```

### History

The XO Language was conceived in the winter of 2015, and the compiler idea in winter of 2018. We decided that the language needs basically a full browser implemented into it, so it can have a rich debugger and text editor that connects to the cloud and help you get work done.

### Contribute

Contributions are greatly welcomed. Help us define what the ideal interface would be for a terminal-editor-debugger app. Identify the key painpoints in the customer onboarding flow, and help us map out the best solutions. See the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/mountbuild/.github/blob/build/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info if you are just starting out coding.

### Mount

The stone is being developed by the folks at [Mount](https://mount.build), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. Mount started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. Mount funds stone's development. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mountbuild), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mountbuild), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mountbuild). Check out our other GitHub projects as well!

  <em>From Mount you find the Stone, reaching to the Cloud.<br/>
  No where on Earth do you feel the power of Nature all around.<br/>
  With the Cloud so close, you can see, touch, and taste.<br/>
  Feeding your energy to the Stone with haste.<br/>
  Mount holds it shape, like the secret ball.</em>
